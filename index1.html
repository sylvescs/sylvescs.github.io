		<h1>DEFINITION:</h1>
		
		<p style="font-size:20px;color:yellow">A heart bypass is when a coronary artery is blocked 
		and an alternative channel is created in order to improve the circulation. Bypass surgery
		is usually performed in order to treat coronary artery disease.</p>
		
		
		<h2 style="font-size:30px">CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:</h2>
		
		<p style="font-size:20px;color:yellow">Coronary heart disease is considered one of the most common types
		of heart disease.  It affects the individuals by narrowing the bloodflow, oxygen, and the nutrients provided
		to the heart and arteries.  It narrows the pathways by depositing a buildup of cholesterol, fat, and other substances
		along the pathways.  This buildup is identified as plaque.  In addition to narrowing the arteries, it causes symptoms such as
		shortness of breath, angina, and when completely blocked will cause heart attacks.</p>
