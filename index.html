		<h1>My Bypass and Me</H1>
		<p>This semester I had a medical issue where I ended up going to the hospital.  I later ended 
		up needing a triple bypass and a mitrial valve replacement. During this whole fiasco I tried looking up information so I could be 
		better informed about what was happening to me and what will be happening later.  While the information is out there, it's not centralized 
		in one spot so I spent most of my time looking at different websites for the information.  I have compiled some general information that 
		would of been helpful to me when I was going through this previously.</p>
